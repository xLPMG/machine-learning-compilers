7.2 Sketch
**********************************

In this phase, we aim to extend our tensor compiler by implementing new primitives and subsequently optimizing their performance. 
Currently, the compiler is rather limited, as supports only a handful of processing primitives. 
To handle more diverse machine learning workloads, we plan to add selected unary and binary primitives, as presented in `Tensor Processing Primitives <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05755>`_.

We will begin by adding a few unary primitives, specifically **Square**, **Reciprocal**, and **Increment & Decrement**.
Since our compiler does not yet support any binary primitives, our next step will be to implement **Add & Sub**, **Mul & Div** and **Max & Min**.

Regarding the implementation, we anticipate that some primitives may be more challenging than others.
For example, we need to account for edge cases, such as division by zero in the **Reciprocal** and **Div** operations.
However, as we have already developed some unary primitives, integrating the new ones into our current framework should be relatively straightfoward.

The situation is slightly different for the binary primitives. 
We do not have a direct starting point for these, but our plan is to integrate them similar to the existing main primitives. 
That said, as this approach is still untested, we may encounter compatibility issues that will need to be addressed along the way.

Importantly, we aim not only to integrate these implementations into our framework but also to achieve a high performance.
Therefore, we plan to optimize these primitives as much as possible. 

Given, that this is a relatively short-term project, we will need to assess our progress as we go.
If time allows, we would also like to further optimize our tensor operations by implementing **dimension fusion** and **dimension reordering**. 
Since we already have some other optimizations in place, integrating these should not result in major issues, although we do expect some challenges along the way.

**********************************
7.3 Implementation
**********************************

As suggested in our sketch, our plan was to implement the new functionalities in the following order:

1. Unary Primitives
2. Binary Primitives

7.3.1 Unary Primitives
====================================

For the unary primitives we were looking at **Square**, **Reciprocal**, **Increment** and **Decrement** operations.

7.3.1.1 Square Primitive
-------------------------

Our initial approach was to use instructions that we already had implemented.
Therefore, we started by using the ``FMLA`` instruction.
However, we quickly realized that the performance from multiplying two values and adding a zero value to it was not great. We decided to implement new instructions which would make our code more performant:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: ``FMUL`` (vector) instruction generation

    constexpr uint32_t fmulVec(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                               simd_fp_t reg_src1,
                               simd_fp_t reg_src2,
                               arr_spec_t arr_spec)
    {
        if (arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s2 && 
            arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s4 &&
            arr_spec != arr_spec_t::d2)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid arrangement specifier");
        }

        uint32_t l_ins = 0x2E20DC00;

        // set destination register id
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);

        // set first source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src1 & 0x1f) << 5;

        // set second source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src2 & 0x1f) << 16;

        // set arrangement specifier
        l_ins |= (arr_spec & 0x40400000);

        return l_ins;
    }

This ``FMUL`` (vector) allowed us to multiply several elements simultaneously. 
For the cases where we needed to multiply single elements (``arr_spec_t::``) together, we implemented the following instruction:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: ``FMUL`` (scalar) instruction generation

    constexpr uint32_t fmulScalar(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                                  simd_fp_t reg_src1,
                                  simd_fp_t reg_src2,
                                  neon_size_spec_t size_spec)
    {
        if (size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::s && 
            size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::d)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid size specifier");
        }

        uint32_t l_ins = 0x1E200800;

        // set destination register id
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);

        // set first source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src1 & 0x1f) << 5;

        // set second source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src2 & 0x1f) << 16;

        // set size specifier
        l_ins |= (size_spec & 0x3) << 22;

        return l_ins;
    }

These instructions allowed us to develop a kernel for the squared primitive. 
The approach for constructing this kernel was similar to the ``zero``, ``ReLU`` or ``identity`` kernel. 

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Calculating iterations and remainder

    int mLoopIterations = m / 16;
    int mLoopRemainder = m % 16;

As a first step, we would calculate how many iterations we had to perform. 
With this number, we were then able to execute our main kernel accordingly:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: squared primitive main loop calculation

    ldp(v0, v1, x8, 0, q)
    ldp(v2, v3, x8, 32, q)

    fmulVec(v4, v0, v0, s4)
    fmulVec(v5, v1, v1, s4)
    fmulVec(v6, v2, v2, s4)
    fmulVec(v7, v3, v3, s4)

    stp(v4, v5, x9, 0, q)
    stp(v6, v7, x9, 32, q)

That means, in our main loop we would calculate 16 squared elements in one iteration. 
If there were no iterations left, we had to check if there would be a remainder: 

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Squared kernel remainder calculation

    case 8:
        kernel.add_instr({
            ldp(v0, v1, x8, 0, q),
            fmulVec(v2, v0, v0, s4),
            fmulVec(v3, v1, v1, s4),
            stp(v2, v3, x9, 0, q)
        });
        break;
    case 9:
        kernel.add_instr({
            ldp(v0, v1, x8, 0, q),
            fmulVec(v2, v0, v0, s4),
            fmulVec(v3, v1, v1, s4),
            stp(v2, v3, x9, 0, q),

            ldr(v4, x8, 32, s),
            fmulScalar(v5, v4, v4, s),
            str(v5, x9, 32, s)
        });
        break;

We had to calculate the remainder for all of our 15 cases, in order to guarantee a correctly functioning kernel. 
After implementing the kernel, we also verified its correctness for different configurations:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Testing dimensions

    uint32_t M = GENERATE(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16);
    uint32_t N = GENERATE(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16);
    test_square_primitive(M, N);

In order to be universally usable, we have also implemented a transposition square kernel. 
The implementation for this kernel was simple, as we could reuse the ``ReLU`` kernel and replace the ReLU operation with the square operation: 

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Squared transposition primitive main loop calculation

    // Load 4x4 block of A (input matrix)
    ldr(v0, x7, 0, q)
    add(x7, x7, x2, 0, 0)
    ldr(v1, x7, 0, q)
    add(x7, x7, x2, 0, 0)
    ldr(v2, x7, 0, q)
    add(x7, x7, x2, 0, 0)
    ldr(v3, x7, 0, q)

    // Square values
    fmulVec(v0, v0, v0, s4)
    fmulVec(v1, v1, v1, s4)
    fmulVec(v2, v2, v2, s4)
    fmulVec(v3, v3, v3, s4)

    // Transpose 4x4 block
    // TRN
    trn1(v4, v0, v2, s4)
    trn1(v5, v1, v3, s4)
    trn2(v6, v0, v2, s4)
    trn2(v7, v1, v3, s4)

    // ZIP
    zip1(v8, v4, v5, s4)
    zip1(v9, v6, v7, s4)

    zip2(v10, v4, v5, s4)
    zip2(v11, v6, v7, s4)

    // Store 4x4 Block of B
    str(v8, x8, 0, q)
    add(x8, x8, x3, 0, 0)
    str(v9, x8, 0, q)
    add(x8, x8, x3, 0, 0)
    str(v10, x8, 0, q)
    add(x8, x8, x3, 0, 0)
    str(v11, x8, 0, q)

However, that also meant we were limited to a ``4x4`` kernel, which would reduce our overall performance. 
For the transposition kernel, we did not implement any further optimizations. 

On the other hand, for the normal squared kernel we enhanced our initial dimension size from ``M=8`` to ``M=16``.

Lastly, we performed benchmarks similar to those of the other unary kernels:

This time we were measuring the throughput of our kernel, differently to the ``zero``, ``identity``, and ``ReLU`` kernel, where we were measuring the data transfer rate.

7.3.1.2 Reciprocal Primitive
------------------------------

The next primitive we implemented is the ``reciprocal`` operation, which computes ``1.0 / x`` for all input values ``x``.
For this, the AArch64 ISA already provides two instructions ``FRECPE`` and ``FRECPS``. ``FRECPE`` is the ``floating point reciprocal compute estimate`` instruction, which computes a first estimate of ``1.0 / x``. However, this estimate is generally not good enough for 32-bit floating point precision. To solve this, we can utilize ``FRECPS`` (``floating point reciprocal compute step``) iteratively, which improves the accuracy of the previously calculated estimate. We decided to perform only one step, as this already satisfied our used 32-bit floating point precision.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: ``FRECPE`` instruction generation 

    constexpr uint32_t frecpeVec(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                                 simd_fp_t reg_src,
                                 arr_spec_t arr_spec)
    {

        // set destination register id - Rd
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);
        // set source register id - Rn
        l_ins |= (reg_src & 0x1f) << 5;
        // set arrangement specifier
        l_ins |= (arr_spec & 0x40400000);
        return l_ins;
    }

    {
        if (size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::s && 
            size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::d)
        {
                throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid size specifier");
        }
        u_int32_t l_ins = 0x5EA1D800;
        // set destination register id - Rd

        // set source register id - Rn
        l_ins |= (reg_src & 0x1f) << 5;
        // set size specifier
        l_ins |= (size_spec & 0x1) << 22;
        return l_ins;
    }

.. code-block:: cpp

                                    size_spec_t size_spec)
    {
        if (size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::s && 
            size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::d)
        {
                throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid size specifier");
        }
        u_int32_t l_ins = 0x5E20FC00;
        // set destination register id - Rd
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);
        // set first source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src1 & 0x1f) << 5;
        // set second source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src2 & 0x1f) << 16;
        // set size specifier
        l_ins |= (size_spec & 0x1) << 22;
        return l_ins;
    }

To compute the reciprocal, we also needed the ``FMUL`` instruction which we implemented in the previous section. A full reciprocal computation looks like this:

.. code:: asm

    frecpe  v0.4s, v1.4s        // Estimate reciprocal of v1 and save to v0
    frecps  v2.4s, v1.4s, v0.4s // Refine reciprocal
    fmul    v0.4s, v0.4s, v2.4s // Apply refinement -> v0 now has better estimate

With these instructions, we began implementing the new kernel. Structurally it is identical to the square primitive. We simply replaced the calculations with the new instructions:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Reciprocal primitive main loop calculation

    kernel.add_instr({
        // load 16 elements from A
        ldp(v0, v1, x8, 0, q),
        ldp(v2, v3, x8, 32, q),

        frecpeVec(v4, v0, s4),
        frecpsVec(v10, v0, v4, s4),
        fmulVec(v4, v4, v10, s4),

        frecpeVec(v5, v1, s4),
        frecpsVec(v10, v1, v5, s4),
        fmulVec(v5, v5, v10, s4),

        frecpeVec(v6, v2, s4),

        frecpsVec(v10, v3, v7, s4),
        fmulVec(v7, v7, v10, s4),

        // store 16 elements to B
        stp(v4, v5, x9, 0, q),
        stp(v6, v7, x9, 32, q),

        // jump by 16 rows
        add(x8, x8, 16*4, 0),
        add(x9, x9, 16*4, 0),

        // decrement m loop counter
        sub(x7, x7, 1, 0),
    });

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Reciprocal transposition primitive main loop calculation

    kernel.add_instr({
        // working pointer for A and B
        mov(x7, x4)
        mov(x8, x5)
        
        // Load 4x4 block of A (input matrix)

7.3.1.3 Increment and Decrement Primitive
------------------------------------------

The last unary primitives that we wanted to implement were the increment and decrement operations.

Similar to the other primitives, we had to first implement a few new instructions. 
Instructions that were directly needed for these primitives are ``FADD`` and ``FSUB``. 
To fully utilize these instructions, we were implementing both a scalar and a vector version for these instructions:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: ``FADD`` instruction generation 

    constexpr uint32_t faddVec(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                               simd_fp_t reg_src1,
                               simd_fp_t reg_src2,
                               arr_spec_t arr_spec)
    {
        if (arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s2 && 
            arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s4 &&
            arr_spec != arr_spec_t::d2)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid arrangement specifier");
        }
        uint32_t l_ins = 0xE20D400;
        // set destination register id
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);
        // set first source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src1 & 0x1f) << 5;
        // set second source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src2 & 0x1f) << 16;
        // set arrangement specifier
        l_ins |= (arr_spec & 0x40400000);
        return l_ins;
    }

    constexpr uint32_t faddScalar(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                                simd_fp_t reg_src1,
                                simd_fp_t reg_src2,
                                neon_size_spec_t size_spec)
    {
        if (size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::s && 
            size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::d)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid size specifier");
        }
        uint32_t l_ins = 0x1E202800;
        // set destination register id
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);
        // set first source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src1 & 0x1f) << 5;
        // set second source register id
        l_ins |= (reg_src2 & 0x1f) << 16;
        // set size specifier
        l_ins |= (size_spec & 0x3) << 22;
        return l_ins;
    }

Beside these instructions, we needed to move the value ``1`` into a Neon register. 
That meant, we had to also implement the ``FMOV`` instruction. 
Implementing the ``FMOV`` instruction has been slightly different to those of other implementations. 
The main reason for this special behavior is the split of the 8-bit immediate into 1 signed bit, a 3-bit exponent and a 4-bit precision part. 
This unique characteristic changes the use of these 8-bits slightly. 

For example, we have looked at different scenarios for moving a floating point value:

Looking at these examples we were able to find some special cases (e.g. ``1``), but also patterns, that we were trying to apply to our implementation:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: ``FMOV`` (vector, immediate) instruction generation

    constexpr uint32_t fmovVec(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                               int32_t imm8,
                               arr_spec_t arr_spec)
    {
        if (arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s2 && 
            arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s4 && 
            arr_spec != arr_spec_t::d2)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid arrangement specifier");
        }
        int32_t l_ins = 0xF00F400;
        // set destination register id
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);

        if (imm8 > 31 || imm8 < -31)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid immediate (allowed range: -31, 31)");
        }
        if (imm8 < 0)
        {
            l_ins |= (0x1) << 18;
            imm8 *= -1;
        }

        // immediate bits
        if (imm8 == 1)
        {
            l_ins |= (0x3) << 16;
            l_ins |= (0x1) << 9;
        }
        else if (imm8 == 2)
        {
        }
        else if (imm8 == 3)
        {
            l_ins |= (0x1) << 8;
        }
        else if (imm8 < 8)
        {
            l_ins |= (imm8 & 0x7) << 7;
        }
        else
        {
            l_ins |= (0x1) << 16;

            if (imm8 > 8 && imm8 < 16)
            {
                l_ins |= (imm8 & 0x7) << 6;
            }
            else if (imm8 > 16)
            {
                l_ins |= (imm8 & 0x1f) << 5;
            }
        }

        // set arrangement specifier
        if (arr_spec == arr_spec_t::s4)
        {
            l_ins |= (0x1) << 30;
        }
        else if (arr_spec == arr_spec_t::d2)
        {
            l_ins |= (0x1) << 29;
            l_ins |= (0x1) << 30;
        }

        return l_ins;
    }

In practice, we would need the ``FMOV`` instruction to transfer the ``1.0f`` into a vector, in order to be able to execute vector addition and subtraction operations. 

After implementing the instructions we simply took our ``square`` kernel and replaced all multiplication operations with a ``FADD`` or a ``FSUB`` operation:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: square calculation in main loop

    // Set register with value 1
    fmovVec(v19, 1, s4)

    ...

    // load 16 elements from A
    ldp(v0, v1, x8, 0, q)
    ldp(v2, v3, x8, 32, q)

    faddVec(v4, v0, v19, s4)
    faddVec(v5, v1, v19, s4)
    faddVec(v6, v2, v19, s4)
    faddVec(v7, v3, v19, s4)

    // store 16 elements to B
    stp(v4, v5, x9, 0, q)
    stp(v6, v7, x9, 32, q)

    // jump by 16 rows
    add(x8, x8, 16*4, 0)
    add(x9, x9, 16*4, 0)

    // decrement m loop counter
    sub(x7, x7, 1, 0)

After implementing both the ``increment`` and ``decrement`` kernel, we also implemented their transposed versions.

7.3.2 Binary Primitives
====================================

Our second step to get a diverse machine learning compiler was to introduce binary operations.
In order to incorporate these operations into our current framework, our first step was to implement different kernels.
We implemented the kernels in the following order:

1. Add and Sub
2. Mul and Div
3. Max and Min

7.3.2.1 Add and Sub Primitive
---------------------------------

The first binary primitive which we implemented is the element-wise addition and the subtraction of two matrices. Fortunately, the required instructions ``FADD`` and ``FSUB`` were already implemented in :ref:`increment-decrement`.
Since the subtraction kernel is fundamentally the same as the addition kernel, we will only consider the addition kernel in this section.

Similar to previous kernels, we first implemented a main loop for 16 elements in the ``M`` dimension and 1 element in the ``N`` dimension.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Addition kernel: main loop

    kernel.add_label("m_16_loop");
    kernel.add_instr({
        // load 16 elements from A
        simd_fp::ldp(v0, v1, x11, 0, q),
        simd_fp::ldp(v2, v3, x11, 32, q),

        // load 16 elements from B
        simd_fp::ldp(v4, v5, x12, 0, q),
        simd_fp::ldp(v6, v7, x12, 32, q),

        // compute C = A + B
        simd_fp::faddVec(v8, v0, v4, s4),
        simd_fp::faddVec(v9, v1, v5, s4),
        simd_fp::faddVec(v10, v2, v6, s4),
        simd_fp::faddVec(v11, v3, v7, s4),

        // store 16 elements to C
        simd_fp::stp(v8, v9, x13, 0, q),
        simd_fp::stp(v10, v11, x13, 32, q),

        // jump by 16 rows
        base::add(x11, x11, 16*4, 0),
        base::add(x12, x12, 16*4, 0),
        base::add(x13, x13, 16*4, 0),

        // decrement m loop counter
        base::sub(x10, x10, 1, 0),
    });
    // check if loop counter is zero
    kernel.add_instr(base::cbnz(x10, -kernel.getInstrCountFromLabel("m_16_loop") * 4));

If there is a remainder that is smaller than 16, we execute special cases, for example:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Addition kernel: special cases for M = 1...4

    if (mLoopRemainder > 0)
    {
        switch (mLoopRemainder)
        {
        case 1:
            kernel.add_instr({
                // 1 element
                simd_fp::ldr(v0, x11, 0, s),
                simd_fp::ldr(v1, x12, 0, s),
                simd_fp::faddScalar(v2, v0, v1, s),
                simd_fp::str(v2, x13, 0, s)
            });
            break;
        case 2:
            kernel.add_instr({
                // 2 elements
                simd_fp::ldr(v0, x11, 0, d),
                simd_fp::ldr(v1, x12, 0, d),
                simd_fp::faddVec(v2, v0, v1, s2),
                simd_fp::str(v2, x13, 0, d)
            });
            break;
        case 3:
            kernel.add_instr({
                // 2 elements
                simd_fp::ldr(v0, x11, 0, d),
                simd_fp::ldr(v1, x12, 0, d),
                simd_fp::faddVec(v2, v0, v1, s2),
                simd_fp::str(v2, x13, 0, d),

                // 1 element
                simd_fp::ldr(v3, x11, 2*4, s),
                simd_fp::ldr(v4, x12, 2*4, s),
                simd_fp::faddScalar(v5, v3, v4, s),
                simd_fp::str(v5, x13, 2*4, s)
            });
            break;
        case 4:
            kernel.add_instr({
                // 4 elements
                simd_fp::ldr(v0, x11, 0, q),
                simd_fp::ldr(v1, x12, 0, q),
                simd_fp::faddVec(v2, v0, v1, s4),
                simd_fp::str(v2, x13, 0, q)
            });
            break;

7.3.2.2 Mul and Div Primitive
---------------------------------

As we had already implemented a ``GEMM`` kernel, we decided to implement a simple ``Mul`` and ``Div`` kernel, that would support **element-wise** calculations.

Conceptually, implementing a multiplication that is not element-wise would be simply a matrix multiplication and implementing a division of two 
matrices (not element-wise) could be achieved by taking the reciprocal of one of the inputs and multiplying it by the second input.

The implementation for the element-wise multiplication and division was again straight forward, as we could take our ``ADD`` and ``SUB`` kernels, 
and replace the ``FADD`` and ``FSUB`` operations with ``FMUL`` and ``FDIV`` respectively:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Mul primitive main loop calculation
    
    // load 16 elements from A
    ldp(v0, v1, x11, 0, q)
    ldp(v2, v3, x11, 32, q)

    // load 16 elements from B
    ldp(v4, v5, x12, 0, q)
    ldp(v6, v7, x12, 32, q)

    // compute C = A * B
    fmulVec(v8, v0, v4, s4)
    fmulVec(v9, v1, v5, s4)
    fmulVec(v10, v2, v6, s4)
    fmulVec(v11, v3, v7, s4)

    // store 16 elements to C
    stp(v8, v9, x13, 0, q)
    stp(v10, v11, x13, 32, q)

    // jump by 16 rows
    add(x11, x11, 16*4, 0)
    add(x12, x12, 16*4, 0)
    add(x13, x13, 16*4, 0)

    // decrement m loop counter
    sub(x10, x10, 1, 0)

    

7.3.2.3 Max and Min Primitive
---------------------------------

As we had already implemented the ``FMAX`` instruction for our :ref:`relu-primitive`, we only needed to implement the ``FMIN`` instruction generation:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: ``FMIN`` instruction generation

    constexpr uint32_t fminScalar(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                                  simd_fp_t reg_src1,
                                  simd_fp_t reg_src2,
                                  neon_size_spec_t size_spec)
    {
        if (size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::s && size_spec != neon_size_spec_t::d)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid size specifier");
        }
        u_int32_t l_ins = 0x1E205800;
        // set destination register id - Rd
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);
        // set first source register id - Rn
        l_ins |= (reg_src1 & 0x1f) << 5;
        // set second source register id - Rm
        l_ins |= (reg_src2 & 0x1f) << 16;
        // set neon size specifier - size_spec
        l_ins |= size_spec << 22;
        return l_ins;
    }

    constexpr uint32_t fminVec(simd_fp_t reg_dest,
                               simd_fp_t reg_src1,
                               simd_fp_t reg_src2,
                               arr_spec_t arr_spec)
    {
        if (arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s2 && arr_spec != arr_spec_t::s4 &&
            arr_spec != arr_spec_t::d2)
        {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid arrangement specifier");
        }
        u_int32_t l_ins = 0xEA0F400;
        // set destination register id - Rd
        l_ins |= (reg_dest & 0x1f);
        // set first source register id - Rn
        l_ins |= (reg_src1 & 0x1f) << 5;
        // set second source register id - Rm
        l_ins |= (reg_src2 & 0x1f) << 16;
        // set arrangement specifier - arr_spec
        l_ins |= arr_spec;
        return l_ins;
    }

The final primitive is almost identical to the previous kernels, except that we now make calls to the ``FMIN`` and ``FMAX`` instructions:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Max primitive main loop calculation

    kernel.add_label("m_16_loop");
    kernel.add_instr({
        // load 16 elements from A
        simd_fp::ldp(v0, v1, x11, 0, q),
        simd_fp::ldp(v2, v3, x11, 32, q),

        // load 16 elements from B
        simd_fp::ldp(v4, v5, x12, 0, q),
        simd_fp::ldp(v6, v7, x12, 32, q),

        // compute C = max(A, B)
        simd_fp::fmaxVec(v8, v0, v4, s4),
        simd_fp::fmaxVec(v9, v1, v5, s4),
        simd_fp::fmaxVec(v10, v2, v6, s4),
        simd_fp::fmaxVec(v11, v3, v7, s4),

        // store 16 elements to C
        simd_fp::stp(v8, v9, x13, 0, q),
        simd_fp::stp(v10, v11, x13, 32, q),

        // jump by 16 rows
        base::add(x11, x11, 16*4, 0),
        base::add(x12, x12, 16*4, 0),
        base::add(x13, x13, 16*4, 0),

        // decrement m loop counter
        base::sub(x10, x10, 1, 0),
    });
    // check if loop counter is zero
    kernel.add_instr(base::cbnz(x10, -kernel.getInstrCountFromLabel("m_16_loop") * 4));

For the ``Min`` primitive, all ``fmaxVec`` and ``fmaxScalar`` calls were replaced with the respective calls to ``fmin``.

7.3.3 Integration in Framework
====================================

After implementing our unary and binary kernels, we needed to integrate them into our TensorOperation backend.
We started by adjusting our allowed main primitives, and our first and last touches.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: allowed primitive types in a TensorOperation
    
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Check allowed primitive types
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    std::vector<ptype_t> allowed_first_touch_types = {
        ptype_t::none,
        ptype_t::zero,
        ptype_t::relu, 
        ptype_t::square, 
        ptype_t::reciprocal,
        ptype_t::increment,
        ptype_t::decrement
    };
    std::vector<ptype_t> allowed_main_types = {
        ptype_t::none,
        ptype_t::identity, 
        ptype_t::brgemm, 
        ptype_t::gemm,
        ptype_t::add,
        ptype_t::sub,
        ptype_t::mul,
        ptype_t::div,
        ptype_t::min,
        ptype_t::max
    };
    std::vector<ptype_t> allowed_last_touch_types = {
        ptype_t::none,
        ptype_t::relu, 
        ptype_t::square, 
        ptype_t::reciprocal,
        ptype_t::increment,
        ptype_t::decrement
    };

As we had already implemented our ``Unary`` endpoint, which connects the unary primitives to the ``TensorOperation``, this was all we had to do for these primitives. 
For the ``Binary`` primitives the situation was slightly different. First we had to set up our binary primitives. 
We did that by implementing a ``Binary`` endpoint, which makes calls the new binary primitives based on the input parameters:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Binary kernel interface

    switch (ptype)
    {
    case ptype_t::add:
        if (0 == trans_c)
        {
            mini_jit::kernels::binary::add(*m_kernel, m, n);
        }
        else if (1 == trans_c)
        {
            std::cout << "Transposition for add primitive is not supported" << std::endl;
            return error_t::operation_not_supported;
        }
        break;
    case ptype_t::sub:
        if (0 == trans_c)
        {
            mini_jit::kernels::binary::sub(*m_kernel, m, n);
        }
        else if (1 == trans_c)
        {
            std::cout << "Transposition for sub primitive is not supported" << std::endl;
            return error_t::operation_not_supported;
        }
        break;
    case ptype_t::mul:
        if (0 == trans_c)
        {
            mini_jit::kernels::binary::mul(*m_kernel, m, n);
        }
        else if (1 == trans_c)
        {
            std::cout << "Transposition for mul primitive is not supported" << std::endl;
            return error_t::operation_not_supported;
        }
        break;
    case ptype_t::div:
        if (0 == trans_c)
        {
            mini_jit::kernels::binary::div(*m_kernel, m, n);
        }
        else if (1 == trans_c)
        {
            std::cout << "Transposition for div primitive is not supported" << std::endl;
            return error_t::operation_not_supported;
        }
        break;
    case ptype_t::min:
        if (0 == trans_c)
        {
            mini_jit::kernels::binary::min(*m_kernel, m, n);
        }
        else if (1 == trans_c)
        {
            std::cout << "Transposition for min primitive is not supported" << std::endl;
            return error_t::operation_not_supported;
        }
        break;
    case ptype_t::max:
        if (0 == trans_c)
        {
            mini_jit::kernels::binary::max(*m_kernel, m, n);
        }
        else if (1 == trans_c)
        {
            std::cout << "Transposition for max primitive is not supported" << std::endl;
            return error_t::operation_not_supported;
        }
        break;
    default:
        std::cout << "Invalid primitive type" << std::endl;
        return error_t::wrong_ptype;
    }

Inside our TensorOperation, we now also check if there are exactly two primitive dimensions for the new binary primitives:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Checking the number of primitive dimensions for binary primitives

    else if (prim_main == ptype_t::add || prim_main == ptype_t::sub || 
             prim_main == ptype_t::mul || prim_main == ptype_t::div || 
             prim_main == ptype_t::min || prim_main == ptype_t::max)
    {
        if (prim_count != 2)
        {
            return error_t::wrong_exec_type;
        }
    }

Next, we call the generate function of our ``Binary`` endpoint:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Generating the binary kernels

    else if (prim_main == ptype_t::add || prim_main == ptype_t::sub ||
             prim_main == ptype_t::mul || prim_main == ptype_t::div ||
             prim_main == ptype_t::min || prim_main == ptype_t::max)
    {
        m_binary_main.generate(m_dim_sizes[m_dim_id_prim_M],
                               m_dim_sizes[m_dim_id_prim_N],
                               0,
                               dtype,
                               prim_main);
        m_kernel_binary_main = m_binary_main.get_kernel();
        
    }

And lastly, we just need to execute the generated binary kernels:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: Executing the binary kernels
    
    else if (m_kernel_main_type == ptype_t::add || m_kernel_main_type == ptype_t::sub ||
             m_kernel_main_type == ptype_t::mul || m_kernel_main_type == ptype_t::div ||
             m_kernel_main_type == ptype_t::min || m_kernel_main_type == ptype_t::max)
    {
        m_kernel_binary_main(ptr_in0,
                             ptr_in1,
                             ptr_out,
                             ldA,
                             ldB,
                             ldC);
    }

As for the new unary primitives, no major changes needed to be done. 
Our TensorOperation backend already supported unary operations such as ``zero`` and ``relu``, so simply extending it with the new primitives was a trivial task.
