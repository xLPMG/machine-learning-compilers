4. Code Generation
====================

This section sets the foundation for our machine learning compiler.
We are starting off by implementing / generating batch-reduce matrix-matrix multiplications (BRGEMMS).

The first step was to implement a ``generate`` function, which is supposed to be the entry for all BRGEMM code generation:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/Brgemm.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 7-74
    :caption: implementation of the ``generate`` function

In this function we are generating the code for the BRGEMM kernels.

Firstly, we needed the instructions which a BRGEMM kernel consists of.
Therefore we started wrapping the assembly code in C++ functions.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/InstGen.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 140-173
    :caption: Load instruction for a single general purpose register 

After implementing all necessary instructions, we started implementing our first kernel.
The first kernel that we implemented was a simple matrix multiplication kernel, in the form of a ``matmul_16_6_1``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/kernels/matmul_16_6_1.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 71-131
    :caption: FMLA instructions for the ``matmul_16_6_1`` kernel

After implementing this first kernel, we started implementing a more general version with a ``matmul_16_6_k`` kernel.
For this kernel we needed a loop to iterate over the ``k`` dimension.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/kernels/matmul_16_6_k.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 133-146
    :caption: Loop instruction using code generation

As a last step we measured the performance of our generated code, resulting in the following results:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/benchmark/benchmarking_results_matmul_16_6.txt
    :language: text
    :caption: GFLOPs results of the ``matmul_16_6_1`` and ``matmul_16_6_k`` kernels

Comparing our ``matmul_16_6_1`` kernel to our previous implementations, we are slightly worse, loosing about ``8 GFLOPs``.
However, for the ``matmul_16_6_k`` we reach the same number of GFLOPs that we reached with our best implementations.
